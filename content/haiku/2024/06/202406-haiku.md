**Sat, 2024.06.01**

It is the weekend

But I am in bed all day

That time of the month


**Sun, 2024.06.02**

I woke up past eight

Went weak but came home recharged

Friends in God give strength


**Mon, 2024.06.03**

In a foreign tongue

I struggle, making no sense

Belittled, I thrive


**Tue, 2024.06.04**

Struggling but heard

For the patience, I thank you

Mutual respect


**Wed, 2024.06.05**

Creampuff for breakfast

Craved the sweet, body then slumped

Regret, lesson learned


**Thu, 2024.06.06**

Ages since last book

Skeptic of tech books, found out

basics stay timeless


**Fri, 2024.06.07**

Twenty-four, but still

so much to achieve and see

Fear of thirties looms


**Sat, 2024.06.08**

Saturdays at home

Neglected tasks find their end

Outdoors calls next week


**Sun, 2024.06.09**

Once more, heartfelt talks

Love shared like in days before

With dear mom, tonight


**Mon, 2024.06.10**

Old man's wisdom, guide

Past five, to own goals we stride

Towards dreams, we work


**Tue, 2024.06.11**

Observe my own steps

Sorting what works, what does not

Life's mess slowly clears


**Wed, 2024.06.12**

Day's tasks neatly done

Yet evening whispers of rest

Tasks slip with the night


**Thu, 2024.06.13**

Work sails, smooth and sure

Tasks meet time, past struggles fade

With experience gained


**Fri, 2024.06.14**

Late wake-up, sleepy

Weariness lingers all day

Film with dear, unwind


**Sun, 2024.06.16**

Sunday with toddlers

Awkward, yet a child once more

Made a cool friend too


**Mon, 2024.06.17**

Fell asleep early

Japanese book in my hands

_Ganbarimasu_


**Tue, 2024.06.18**

Lost track of time again

Editing and checking views

Midnight—time to sleep


**Thu, 2024.06.20**

Simple day unfolds

Workload light, more time to rest

Breathing easy now


**Fri, 2024.06.21**

Work from home by day

Indonesian dine out by night

Life's course reassured


**Sat, 2024.06.22**

Staying home today

Clearing mess, I declutter

Lightness fills the air


**Sun, 2024.06.23**

Church hour, then lunch

Girls discuss life, love, and such

Shared views enlighten



**Mon, 2024.06.24**

Plans to visit home

December’s days work the best

See parents while we can


**Tue, 2024.06.25**

Different words bring laughs

Embarrassed by my Japanese

Sweaty sleep, unwashed


**Wed, 2024.06.26**

Thorough code review

Avoiding offense, I strive

Recent reads guide me


**Thu, 2024.06.27**

Morning bus, eyes trace

Maybe recall my face

Lesson learned, move on


**Fri, 2024.06.28**

Code review at home

Questions, not code, fill the day

Showing why and how


**Sat, 2024.06.29**

Read, found a typo

Fixed and approved—a debut

In contribution


**Sun, 2024.06.30**

Late night, Amazon

After church, tableware search

Tableware-obsessed
