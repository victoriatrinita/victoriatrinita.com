But weeks ago, that changed fast

Strength and hope remain

People dressed for summer trips

While I head to work

On the quiet morning train

But rice is scarce now

Bored with Asian faces

Still found joy with them

Harsh words spill, then silence falls

Peace found in escape

Bro’s weekends are calm

Friends have settled with their lives

Tried to match him up
