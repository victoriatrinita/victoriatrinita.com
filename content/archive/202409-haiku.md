**Sun, 2024.09.01**

Plans shifted, we roamed

Stroll around Harajuku

Gossip spiced the night


**Mon, 2024.09.02**

Exhaustive efforts

Impact seems so minimal

Dissatisfaction


**Tue, 2024.09.03**

Yesterday’s work blues

Maybe I just need a break

Summer trip ahead


**Wed, 2024.09.04**

Thought I'd find some rest

But there’s more work than I thought

Sigh, no ease today


**Thu, 2024.09.05**

Five months of effort

Project's end is close at hand

Validation soothes


**Fri, 2024.09.06**

Leading felt awkward

But I'll push through discomfort

Learning never ends


**Sat, 2024.09.07**

Behind strength, unknown

A side I didn’t expect

Each has their burden


**Sun, 2024.09.08**

Looked up to their lives

Now I see a different light

Mom and Dad were right


**Mon, 2024.09.09**

Final review done

A smooth end to our hard work

Leader praised the team


**Tue, 2024.09.10**

Church ministry work

and trip planning the whole day

Tough and challenging


**Wed, 2024.09.11**

Rushed for hiking gear

Left the shops with empty hands

Rain then dashed my plans


**Thu, 2024.09.12**

Late night, plans revised

Two hours of sleep makes work hard

But I got things done


**Fri, 2024.09.13**

Tonight’s nomikai

Surprisingly not draining

Comfort or used to?


**Sat, 2024.09.14**

No sleep, morning rush

Hike fushimi inari

Summer trip begins


**Sun, 2024.09.15**

Journeyed to Ine

Biked, boated, BBQ night

Fireworks by the sea


**Mon, 2024.09.16**

Farewell, kind host

Amanohashidate

A sight to treasure


**Tue, 2024.09.17**

Wandered with Kak Steph

Kyoto temples, then we part

Night in capsule room


**Wed, 2024.09.18**

Working from cafe

Alone in Kyoto hotel

Onsen, calls, breakfast


**Thu, 2024.09.19**

Onsen noon to night

Relax in comfort and peace

Then shinkansen home


**Fri, 2024.09.20**

Returned home last night

Rest body and gather thoughts

Holidays to breathe


**Sat, 2024.09.21**

Woke late, cooked and napped

Watched J-drama, sang at home

1 a.m. showered


**Sun, 2024.09.22**

Resting at home today

Practiced speaking, learned my gaps

Hyougen and kanji


**Mon, 2024.09.23**

Senzokuike

First walk here after two years

Tamagawa next


**Tue, 2024.09.24**

First day back at work

Just research, writing, and talks

Already want rest


**Wed, 2024.09.25**

Summer heat is gone

Yesterday suddenly cold

Autumn’s here for sure


**Thu, 2024.09.26**

Wise like a serpent

Innocent like a dove

I reap what I've sown


**Fri, 2024.09.27**

Dad turns sixty-three

Thankful for health and blessings

Role model always


**Sat, 2024.09.28**

Game day with good folks

Meat, takoyaki, pudding

Liked the game "ito"


**Sun, 2024.09.29**

Church as usual

Then off to check hiking shoes

Stopped at Apple too


**Mon, 2024.09.30**

Spent the day on slides

Reflecting on the past months

For half-year review
