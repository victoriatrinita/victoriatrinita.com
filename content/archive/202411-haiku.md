**Fri, 2024.11.01**

Reading through a book

from before ChatGPT

Pure human insight

Missionary shares

Reaching hearts in Cambodia

Christ’s work through our hands


**Sun, 2024.11.03**

Girls on the road trip

Talks with warm budae-jjigae

Stars shine in Oze


**Mon, 2024.11.04**

Autumn leaves in bloom

Stream and lake in crisp, cool air

A scene beyond words


**Tue, 2024.11.05**

Unaware before

Relationship means sharing

the guy's weakness too


**Wed, 2024.11.06**

Skipped shower last night

Learned film camera rule late

Call from home at night

Christmas tree stands tall

Holiday drinks on display

Yet, true meaning's lost


**Fri, 2024.11.08**

Reviewed Zettelkasten

Wrote book and work summary

Watched TV after


**Sat, 2024.11.09**

Stayed in, no fall sights

Chores done, but hours slip by fast

Wrote at 3 PM

Years since we last talked

She reminded me of how

God has blessed my life

Izakaya feast

Realize how far I am

From great leadership


**Tue, 2024.11.12**

Shopping after work

Heavy bags from 業務スーパー

Saving with each trip


**Wed, 2024.11.13**

Flu hit, lots of sleep

Resting up felt really good

Pause, slow down, and breathe


**Thu, 2024.11.14**

Cramps through work I fight

Should've been firm with my time

Home after dinner


**Fri, 2024.11.15**

Fights don't last as long

I'm learning to handle them

With more thought and care


**Sat, 2024.11.16**

Kamakura day

And night of fun and fondness

Farewell not just yet


**Sun, 2024.11.17**

Thoughts and feelings clash

Is it them or just myself?

Social life's a maze


**Mon, 2024.11.18**

I work with my soul

Yet the pay does not reflect

Yearning for my worth


**Tue, 2024.11.19**

Usual effort

Not seeking to win favor

All blooms in His time


**Wed, 2024.11.20**

A gentle balance

Trust and truth, words and actions

Clear priorities


**Thu, 2024.11.21**

I work in silence

No need to explain myself

If they know, they know


**Fri, 2024.11.22**

Answered their queries

Processed thoughts and notes, brain drained

Cheesecake-making night


**Sat, 2024.11.23**

Woke to add more batter

Day filled with bible study

Talks lasted till night


**Sun, 2024.11.24**

Sunday school toddlers

Parents' trust leaves me in awe

I leave changed each time


**Mon, 2024.11.25**

Work rules upset me

But His example brings peace

Live to be like Christ


**Tue, 2024.11.26**

Twice, he's helped me stay

In doubt and thoughts of leaving

He keeps me grounded

Work stress overwhelms

Leaders reached out, understood

I'll lead as they did


**Thu, 2024.11.28**

Meeting summarised

Took all day, but now it's clear

Was it worth the time?


**Fri, 2024.11.29**

Just as workday ends

Nitpicking overtime rules

Is that all you say?


**Sat, 2024.11.30**

Not my normal self

Strayed from my path, but I fight

To get back on track
