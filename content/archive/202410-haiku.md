Slides for the team’s talk

Simplifying tech concepts

Challenging, but fun

Finalising slides

No sleep for me tonight

Nerves rising with time


**Thu, 2024.10.03**

For the first time heard

Called strong and dependable

My own words ring true

A rare treat just for myself

"Hospital Playlist" on

After church we ride

Ci Flo's first time on the road

I’ll drive too one day

Visa extension set

Decided to skip retreat

Off to plan solo

Woke up at eleven

Nothing done, but still get paid

Just a tiny guilt

First hike on my own

Midpoint start, a twist of fate

God's plan is in place


**Mon, 2024.10.14**

A slow holiday

Cooked and napped throughout the day

Family call at night


**Tue, 2024.10.15**

Nurse in Papua serves

Dantzig’s math solves the unknown

True worth lies within

Morning tasks in haste

Updates clear, goals aligned well

Lord, I thank You, always


**Thu, 2024.10.17**

At work, I brainstormed

Settled on alert system

Prototyping next

Reflecting my views

Hobbies, interests, leadership

Understanding self

No work done today

Typed haikus in afternoon

Feeling somewhat drained


**Wed, 2024.10.23**

Exhibition day

At the booth, I dodge the talks

Unclear on my role

To flee from boredom

I update dependencies

T'was a fun detour

Long call after work

Life updates and want-to-buys

Prototype half-built

Rushed to make progress by noon

Shared, and all went well


**Tue, 2024.10.29**

Even the wisest

Crave simple relationships

People, so diverse


**Wed, 2024.10.30**

Non-productive day

But in the evening, I learned

To speak of His love


**Thu, 2024.10.31**

Lunch with a new friend

Surprised by Halloween snacks

She’s funny and sweet
