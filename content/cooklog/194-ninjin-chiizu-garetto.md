    notes: >
      Sticks to pan when cooking lol maybe my fault for using stainless steel pan.
      I added too much 塩こしょう, maybe that's why it was too salty.
      Doesn't feel like proper food, it feels like budget food or like trying hard to make something out of whatever's left in the fridge at home.
