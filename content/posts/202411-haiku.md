Reading through a book

from before ChatGPT

Pure human insight

Missionary shares

Reaching hearts in Cambodia

Christ’s work through our hands


**Sun, 2024.11.03**

Girls on the road trip

Talks with warm budae-jjigae

Stars shine in Oze


**Mon, 2024.11.04**

Autumn leaves in bloom

Stream and lake in crisp, cool air

A scene beyond words


**Tue, 2024.11.05**

Unaware before

Relationship means sharing

the guy's weakness too


**Wed, 2024.11.06**

Skipped shower last night

Learned film camera rule late

Call from home at night

Christmas tree stands tall

Holiday drinks on display

Yet, true meaning's lost

Reviewed Zettelkasten

Wrote book and work summary

Watched TV after

Stayed in, no fall sights

Chores done, but hours slip by fast

Years since we last talked

She reminded me of how

God has blessed my life

Izakaya feast

Realize how far I am

From great leadership

Shopping after work

Heavy bags from 業務スーパー

Saving with each trip


**Wed, 2024.11.13**

Flu hit, lots of sleep

Resting up felt really good

Pause, slow down, and breathe


**Thu, 2024.11.14**

Cramps through work I fight

Should've been firm with my time

Home after dinner


**Fri, 2024.11.15**

Fights don't last as long

I'm learning to handle them

With more thought and care


**Sat, 2024.11.16**

Kamakura day

And night of fun and fondness

Farewell not just yet


**Sun, 2024.11.17**

Thoughts and feelings clash

Is it them or just myself?

Social life's a maze


**Mon, 2024.11.18**

I work with my soul

Yet the pay does not reflect

Yearning for my worth


**Tue, 2024.11.19**

Usual effort

Not seeking to win favor

All blooms in His time


**Wed, 2024.11.20**

A gentle balance

Trust and truth, words and actions

Clear priorities


**Thu, 2024.11.21**

I work in silence

No need to explain myself

If they know, they know


**Fri, 2024.11.22**

Answered their queries

Processed thoughts and notes, brain drained

Cheesecake-making night


**Sat, 2024.11.23**

Woke to add more batter

Day filled with bible study

Talks lasted till night

Sunday school toddlers

Parents' trust leaves me in awe

I leave changed each time

But His example brings peace

Live to be like Christ

Twice, he's helped me stay

In doubt and thoughts of leaving

He keeps me grounded

Leaders reached out, understood

I'll lead as they did


**Thu, 2024.11.28**

Meeting summarised

Took all day, but now it's clear

Was it worth the time?
