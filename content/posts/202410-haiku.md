**Tue, 2024.10.01**

Slides for the team’s talk

Simplifying tech concepts

Challenging, but fun


**Wed, 2024.10.02**

Finalising slides

No sleep for me tonight

Nerves rising with time


**Thu, 2024.10.03**

For the first time heard

Called strong and dependable

My own words ring true


**Fri, 2024.10.04**

Paid my sleep debt back

Finished "Quartet" today, next

"Hospital Playlist"


**Sat, 2024.10.05**

Supermarket meals

A rare treat just for myself

"Hospital Playlist" on


**Sun, 2024.10.06**

After church we ride

Ci Flo's first time on the road

I’ll drive too one day


**Mon, 2024.10.07**

Visa extension set

Decided to skip retreat

Off to plan solo


**Tue, 2024.10.08**

Unexpected stop

ミスド at the station

Honey churros—shocked!


**Wed, 2024.10.09**

Woke up at eleven

Nothing done, but still get paid

Just a tiny guilt


**Thu, 2024.10.10**

Daiso was the plan

But found Gyomu Super and

flowers too—pure joy


**Fri, 2024.10.11**

Corporate event

Suit on, I’m here for the food

No need for small talk


**Sat, 2024.10.12**

Sony buds arrived

Changed hike plan to Kanagawa

Shopped for tomorrow


**Sun, 2024.10.13**

First hike on my own

Midpoint start, a twist of fate

God's plan is in place


**Mon, 2024.10.14**

A slow holiday

Cooked and napped throughout the day

Family call at night


**Tue, 2024.10.15**

Nurse in Papua serves

Dantzig’s math solves the unknown

True worth lies within


**Wed, 2024.10.16**

Morning tasks in haste

Updates clear, goals aligned well

Lord, I thank You, always


**Thu, 2024.10.17**

At work, I brainstormed

Settled on alert system

Prototyping next


**Fri, 2024.10.18**

Reflecting my views

Hobbies, interests, leadership

Understanding self


**Sat, 2024.10.19**

Company BBQ

Gyutan grilling in the sun

Karaoke with peers


**Sun, 2024.10.20**
Indonesia fest

Nasi Padang, gethuk, and more

Taste of home today


**Mon, 2024.10.21**

Coat on, autumn's here

Thai snacks from our Thai member

Dinner with her too!


**Tue, 2024.10.22**

No work done today

Typed haikus in afternoon

Feeling somewhat drained


**Wed, 2024.10.23**

Exhibition day

At the booth, I dodge the talks

Unclear on my role


**Thu, 2024.10.24**

To flee from boredom

I update dependencies

A fun detour


**Fri, 2024.10.25**

**Sat, 2024.10.26**

**Sun, 2024.10.27**

**Mon, 2024.10.28**

Rushed to make progress by noon

Shared, and all went well
