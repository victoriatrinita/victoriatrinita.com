**Thu, 2025.05.01**

Now I understand

God was shaping empathy

Pure, but not naive


**Fri, 2025.05.02**

Full day of writing

Worked on 仕様書 overtime

Made siomay after


**Sat, 2025.05.03**

I reply too slow

It hurts the ones who trust me

Must break this habit


**Sun, 2025.05.04**

Joyful Sunday comes

Loved and loving in His church

Heart renewed again


**Mon, 2025.05.05**

A full day with friends

You put me here for a reason

To reflect Your love


**Tue, 2025.05.06**

Unfocused again

My thoughts drift from Your purpose

Refocus me, Lord


**Wed, 2025.05.07**

Slept at four a.m.

Still got things done, start to end

Thank You, Lord, for strength


**Thu, 2025.05.08**

Work mails showed the moves

Chatted Dad with love midday

Cooked shrimp—first, tonight


**Fri, 2025.05.09**

Thoughts ran all day, but

Orange juice I made, shrimp cooked

Were today's highlight


**Sat, 2025.05.10**

Drowned in Japanese

They may be as drained as me

No choice — I'll improve


**Sun, 2025.05.11**

Those I care about

Kids and grown-ups shape my soul

To resemble Him


**Mon, 2025.05.12**

Anger slipped through me

I may have hurt someone else

Lord, forgive and lead


**Tue, 2025.05.13**

Not by strength or skill—

God alone can change a heart

I'm just His vessel


**Wed, 2025.05.14**

Not sure what I did—

Was it Your will or just mine?

Please lead my mind back


**Thu, 2025.05.15**

Caught flu, I fought hard

Did all I could to stay fit

Call delayed my rest


**Fri, 2025.05.16**

Project is at risk

But God may be using this

To show how I act


**Sat, 2025.05.17**

Cooked kaprao at last

One dish led to honest talk

About how we're treated


**Sun, 2025.05.18**

Woke up excited

To meet people at the church

Finally talked to auntie


**Mon, 2025.05.19**

Went to work with flu

Glad I didn't pass out once

Something good came too


**Tue, 2025.05.20**

Didn't feel so well

Still showed up and took it slow

Warm drinks helped me through


**Wed, 2025.05.21**

Worked on their project

But mine—the one I believe in—

Got support today


**Thu, 2025.05.22**

Toilet stop detour

Stopped by the bookstore by chance

Got cookbook and hike guide


**Fri, 2025.05.23**

Other work took time

Couldn't touch my own research

Shopped, cooked, called, then sleep


**Sat, 2025.05.24**

Woke with aching cramps

Rested till noon, then cooked food

Still, I did something


**Sun, 2025.05.25**

Church, then quick lunch out

Ankle still hurts every step

More than a month now


**Mon, 2025.05.26**

They know it's high worth

But won't let me focus in—

Half-hearted support.


**Tue, 2025.05.27**

Plate dropped, food all spilled

I ate off the floor to gain

strength to clean the mess


**Wed, 2025.05.28**

Meant to buy one plate

To replace the one I broke—

Bought more out of need


**Thu, 2025.05.29**

**Fri, 2025.05.30**

Teeth seem fine at glance,

but I've treated them badly—

sudden awareness.


**Sat, 2025.05.31**

I sense it's not right—

the way my mind stays busy

with things You don't will
