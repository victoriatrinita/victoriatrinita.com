**Thu, 2025.05.01**

Now I understand

God was shaping empathy

Pure, but not naive


**Fri, 2025.05.02**

Full day of writing

Worked on 仕様書 overtime

Made siomay after


**Sat, 2025.05.03**

I reply too slow

It hurts the ones who trust me

Must break this habit


**Sun, 2025.05.04**

Joyful Sunday comes

Loved and loving in His church

Heart renewed again


**Mon, 2025.05.05**

A full day with friends

You put me here for a reason

To reflect Your love


**Tue, 2025.05.06**

Unfocused again

My thoughts drift from Your purpose

Refocus me, Lord


**Wed, 2025.05.07**

Slept at four a.m.

Still got things done, start to end

Thank You, Lord, for strength


**Thu, 2025.05.08**

Work mails showed the moves

Chatted Dad with love midday

Cooked shrimp—first, tonight


**Fri, 2025.05.09**

**Sat, 2025.05.10**

Drowned in Japanese

They may be as drained as me

No choice — I'll improve


**Sun, 2025.05.11**

Those I care about

Kids and grown-ups shape my soul

To resemble Him


**Mon, 2025.05.12**

Anger slipped through me

I may have hurt someone else

Lord, forgive and lead


**Tue, 2025.05.13**

Not by strength or skill—

God alone can change a heart

I'm just His vessel


**Wed, 2025.05.14**

Not sure what I did—

Was it Your will or just mine?

Please lead my mind back


**Thu, 2025.05.15**

Caught flu, I fought hard

Did all I could to stay fit

Call delayed my rest


**Fri, 2025.05.16**

Project is at risk

But God may be using this

To show how I act


**Sat, 2025.05.17**

**Sun, 2025.05.18**

Woke up excited

To meet people at the church

Finally talked to auntie


**Mon, 2025.05.19**

Went to work with flu

Glad I didn't pass out once

Something good came too


**Tue, 2025.05.20**

**Wed, 2025.05.21**

**Thu, 2025.05.22**

**Fri, 2025.05.23**

**Sat, 2025.05.24**

Woke with aching cramps

Rested till noon, then cooked food

Still, I did something


**Sun, 2025.05.25**
