## True Rest

**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agDQEITG_kg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agDQEITG_kg)**

> **Matthew 11:28–29 (NIV)**
> **28** “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
> **29** Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.”

I believe this passage is already very well known—popular and familiar to our ears. Many preachers have preached from it, and I believe there are books written with themes drawn from these verses. We have heard it preached again and again for a long time. Naturally, this passage is famous because it contains a promise of **rest**. Who does not want rest, my brothers and sisters?
The question is: **what does “rest” actually mean here?** Many people misunderstand the word *rest* in this passage.

> “Come to Me, and I will give you rest.”

Most people assume that the rest spoken of here means:

* Relief because one who was sick becomes healed
* Relief because one who had no life partner finally finds a spouse
* Relief because one who was in debt can now pay it off
* Relief because one who had no children now has descendants
* Relief because one who had no house now owns a house
* Relief because one who had many problems now has none that cause pain

This understanding is actually **incorrect**. What, then, is the difference between coming to Jesus and going to a shaman or a so-called spiritual healer? Both promise solutions to worldly problems, both aim at fulfilling physical or temporal needs.

We must understand the true essence of the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ is **not** about solving problems related to the fulfillment of physical needs. The fulfillment of physical needs already has its own laws and systems. If you are sick, you can go to a doctor, change your diet, or adjust your lifestyle. If you have economic problems, you can work hard, live frugally, and gradually overcome them.

Indeed, there are matters that truly require God’s help—things beyond our ability, whatever the problem may be. But the core problem of human life is **not** the fulfillment of physical needs. If it were, then all religions could promise the same thing. But Jesus brings a blessing that no one else can give.

The “rest” in this passage means **cessation**, **rest**, **repose**. The Greek word is *anapausō*—to cause to rest. But this rest does not mean “being freed from unpleasant circumstances.” It is not, as mentioned earlier, moving from sickness to health, from poverty to wealth, and then feeling relieved. If that were all, even the powers of darkness could provide it.
This rest must be understood from **God’s perspective**—a kind of rest that the world cannot give, that no one else can give. Only God can give it. Only the Lord Jesus Christ can give this God-defined rest.

In Indonesian, this word *rest* is translated into two different words:

1. “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you **rest**.”
2. “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me… and you will find **rest for your souls**.”

These are actually the **same Greek word**, but one is translated as *rest* and the other as *rest for your souls*. If one is not careful, this can lead to misinterpretation. Ideally, verse 28 and verse 29 should both be rendered consistently as *rest*. Unfortunately, this difference in translation can confuse people.

The Lord says, “Come to Me, and I will give you rest.” But to **experience** this rest, one must **learn**. That is why Jesus says, “Learn from Me.” Only then will you experience this rest.
So, my brothers and sisters, this rest is **true repose**, and to enjoy God’s rest, one must learn from God. It is not automatic. “Learn from Me,” and only then will you enjoy that rest.

Many people misunderstand this. They say, “Let us pray, let us pray for you, and you will receive rest,” meaning that your worldly problems will be resolved. Rest is interpreted as the fulfillment of needs—feeling satisfied, complete, lacking nothing.
This is misleading. Christians must understand that our lives are not complete because we have a spouse, or a house, or because our dreams are fulfilled. Our lives are complete because we find **rest in the Lord**, rest in Jesus Christ. This is what you must understand.

Rest in Jesus Christ is a life that is complete, whole, lacking nothing—even if one possesses nothing and no one. The principle is simple: **“Jesus is enough for me.”**

But how can this happen? Many people think that believing in Jesus automatically gives them rest. Remember what the Lord said: *“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives”* (John 14:27, NIV). Anyone can enjoy worldly comfort, but the peace of Christ—*His* peace—can only be understood and enjoyed by those who are able to receive it.

A person may own a luxury car, but if they cannot drive it, the car is useless. Likewise, the peace God gives cannot be enjoyed by just anyone. Rest in Jesus Christ cannot be enjoyed by just anyone. One must **learn** from Him.

What do we learn from Him? His life. We learn from the way Jesus lived. His principle of life was:

> “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work” (John 4:34, NIV).

In other words, *my sustenance*, my provision, is to do the Father’s will and complete His work. Jesus declared that nothing in His life was for Himself; everything was for the Father. That is why He gave up all His rights and became obedient to death—even death on a cross. He surrendered **all His rights** and lived solely for the interests of the Father in heaven.
This is the life of Jesus. This is the pinnacle of freedom—what in English we might call **ultimate freedom**, the highest, truest freedom.

Why are people weary and burdened? “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened.” Why are they weary? Because of their desires, passions, personal ambitions, personal dreams. All of these are exhausting. In this fallen world, there is no true happiness. Whatever goals you achieve, whatever you possess, **will not** make you truly happy—unless you become a child of this world, nurtured by the powers of darkness. And that is how most people live. But that happiness is **false**—a happiness that parks people in this world and leads them into eternal darkness. And that is what exhausts them.

Again, this is from God’s perspective. If you believe in Jesus, you must believe this truth: there is no true happiness in this world. If we want rest in God, we must learn from Jesus, whose principle of life was “to do the will of the Father and finish His work.”

This sounds absurd: *“What kind of life is this?”*
But this is the consequence of being redeemed. This is the consequence of accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior. As Scripture says in **1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (NIV)**:

> “You are not your own; you were bought at a price.”

What percentage belongs to us, and what percentage belongs to God? God says clearly: **you are not your own**—meaning 100% belongs to God. This is not primarily about money, offerings, or tithes. Those are small matters. This is about the posture of the heart—acknowledging that our lives belong to God and living under His sovereignty.

We will regret it if we try to please ourselves in worldly ways. One day we will stand before God, and He may say, “Were you not Mine? Why did you seek worldly pleasure like the children of this world?”
Even if you gain the whole world, what good is it if your soul is lost? How long can you enjoy it—80 years? 90? Rarely more than 100. This world is dangerous because the powers of darkness offer beauty and pleasure, and it is dangerous to enjoy the world as though it were harmless simply because we do not break laws or social norms.

Being children of God is **extraordinary**. When I say “not enjoying the world,” I do not mean that we have no joy in life. On the contrary, we gain true rest. Sleeping on a soft bed or on a hard board—it is the same. Eating tender meat or salted fish—it does not matter. This is not about taste; it is about the **heart**. Living in a big house or a small rented one—again, the heart. Driving a luxury car or riding a motorcycle—our joy should not come from objects. The issue is the heart.

God wants to give us rest. That is why Paul could say, *“If we have food and clothing, we will be content with that”* (1 Timothy 6:8, NIV).
This does not mean we are forbidden to enjoy life. The Holy Spirit guides us. We are not animals. We can enjoy music, food, nature, and relationships—but none of these should bind us. We enjoy them **in God’s presence**, with a constant awareness of Him.

If one day we lose a relationship, it is okay. If one day we cannot live in a big house, a small one is fine. We are not bound to this world. We can enjoy its facilities without being enslaved by them, because our principle is “to do the will of the Father and finish His work.”

Day by day, our concern is this: not to grieve the Father’s heart. In every word we speak, every action, decision, and choice, we desire to bring a smile to the Father in heaven. We do not all have to become missionaries to remote places. Some are called to that, but not many. What matters is living moment by moment according to the Father’s will. That is where rest is found.

If, however, our concern is our own pleasure, pride, and honor without regard for God’s heart, we will grow weary. Others have houses—we do not. Others are respected—we are not. Others have spouses and children—we do not. Is that not exhausting?

One key word here is **simplicity**. Recently, before sleeping, this word keeps coming to my mind. Life must be simple. Accept whatever God entrusts to us. Live what must be lived. Above all, do not wound the Father’s heart.

I once wrote a song with these lines:

> I no longer ask for anything from You, Father in heaven
> You alone are my need, my longing
> Only one thing I ask—to be pleasing in Your sight
> To delight You in all things, to be Your joy

Here we find true freedom. It cannot be fully explained; it must be experienced.

Let me give another example. As a pastor, I once wanted to become a *big* pastor—large congregation, grand building, great music, TV and radio ministries—because others could do it, so I wanted to do it too. God did not forbid it, but was it the Father’s will? I did not care. I just wanted to be pleased.
That was exhausting. When attendance dropped, when people left, when offerings decreased—I was hurt. Life must be simple.

If you do not have a house yet, rent one. Simple. When you have money, buy one. If you cannot afford a car, ride a motorcycle. Others travel abroad; you go to Jogja and still be happy. We are not forbidden to enjoy life—but we do it **with God**, simply.

If we live this way, one day we will discover our purpose—why we were created. We will stand before Jesus and say, “Lord, I have finished my task.”
That is **true rest**. And those who possess this true rest will enjoy eternal rest in the kingdom of heaven.

Few enter this realm because many distrust God. They say, “This kind of life is extreme, unnatural.” But Jesus lived an “unnatural” life in human eyes. So did Paul, who said, *“For to me, to live is Christ”* (Philippians 1:21, NIV).

Indulging in pleasure in this fallen world is dangerous. The safest principle is to do the Father’s will and finish His work. In the new heaven and new earth, we will enjoy all beauty fully.

As humans, we too desire beautiful homes and pleasant lives—but we postpone them. True rest is found only in God. And the ultimate joy is not the beauty of heaven itself, but **meeting the Lord face to face**—the One who died for us.

Therefore, we return to Matthew 11:29: *“Take My yoke upon you.”* The yoke represents training and submission. God trains us so that we may be used by Him. Jesus is gentle and humble in heart. Submit yourself to the process. God will shape you patiently.

I love this phrase I recently found: **“I must be finished before I finish.”**
Before I die, I must already be finished—asking for nothing but to be pleasing to God. This is the peak of freedom. This is **true rest**.

Jesus is the greatest luxury of all. His peace is not like the world’s. May we have hearts that can receive His grace and enjoy His rest.

Amen.
