# I Don't Balance, I Juggle

Juggle illustration
- kadang ada yg kepegang, ada yang engga
- ada yang di atas, ada yg di bawah
- sometimes the balls also fall out of reach of my hands, but i pick it up again.. and start juggling again..
- but also there are times when it's time to let the ball out of our juggling hands, delegating it, but we take another ball (lol)

Balance illustration

- Family
- Work
- Friends (diff circle of friends, in indonesia, in japan (at work, at church))
- Personal time (processing thoughts, writing) and development (personal website, running, driving, language learning, stabilize career change coding etc)
- Church ministry volunteer

- All those sections are done alongwith faith but i still fail to set aside a special time for God not while doing something else

Thing is i do things with full consciousness so i dont act if i am on half conscience. i dont multitask. That's my limitation but also strength.

Often times, i am available on one then absent on the other.

Just as i thought the day was ending with a happy (at-least-to-some-extent-i-can-breathe) ending at work, on the same day at night come up problems at other aspects because i was absent there.
Lol.

but to be honest, i put more emphasis of my efforts on work because i see it as my medium to share the news about Him.

I juggle.
That's expected.

Maybe that’s just life of an adult. That’s just life gorlll.
But I went through it all lol and I will go through my whole life onwards juggling and still standing (even if i stumble, i won't fall) because I've got the Lord's strength in me.
