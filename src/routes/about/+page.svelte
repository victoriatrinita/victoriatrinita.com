		<p>
			Hello, I am Victoria Trinita Pardede, a final year Information Engineering student at
			Universitas Gadjah Mada. I enjoy exploring the world of web development.
		</p>

		<h2 id="backstory">This Website's Backstory</h2>

		<p>
			I remember in primary school, our teachers used to assign us to make scrapbooks that showcase
			certain information. The topics that I still remember were 'types of traditional houses' and
			'different kinds of animals'. I gathered information from books at the library and printed
			pictures from the internet. I wrote down the information that I found important and glued the
			matching pictures above. Through that, I found that I enjoy making scrapbooks.
		</p>

		<p>
			From there, I tried making my personal scrapbook that contains information about
			anything—something like an encyclopedia, but self-made. It was filled with article and picture
			cutouts from magazines and newspapers. I made it with the hopes of having my own place to
			refer to when I need information about anything. Eventually, I realize that it is the idea of
			<i>collecting things I find useful from various places in one place</i> that I find interesting.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hence, it became the foundation of this website creation. That is, so that I have a place to
			keep all the things that I want to look back and refer to later on or in the future. But,
			different from my childhood "encyclopedia", this website may not contain informational stuffs.
			The original intention is to keep a documentation of my thoughts and the things I like and
			find meaningful for myself that I can easily digest when I come back to it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other than that, in my 21st year of living, I realise that I love looking back at what I have
			written or posted online back when I was younger. I get to know my own self, years ago. I just
			somehow feel content when I look back at them. However, an issue that I foresee is, just like
			how my answers and questions on Yahoo Answers went gone as the platform closed down early
			2021, my posts on my current social medias might also face the same fate. We never know for
			sure. There <i>are</i> ways to download the data—and I did keep a copy of my Yahoo Answers questions
			and answers in the form of screenshots as well as generated JSON provided by the platform before
			it closed down—but it will never feel the same as scrolling and surfing through the platform itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, I thought, by creating my own platform, <i>I</i> get to manage its fate. As long as I
			have the whole code that builds up the platform (along with its backups, of course) I can always
			keep what I have created until I actually delete it myself—which I would never think of doing. This
			does consume a lot more effort, but hey, developing and maintaining websites and web apps is what
			I do for a living so this counts as a media to hone my skills too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Lastly, keeping things centralised in this platform is also an effort to minimalise having a
			hard time trying to remember the places I have ever posted on like if they were scattered in
			different places. Also, I need not to worry and hassle much when other platforms that I use or
			used to use, go out of business. Not that I intend to refrain from using other platforms at
			all though, as they do serve other purposes not coverable in this static web.
		</p>

		<p>Wrapping up, I hope this place stays as a permanent "encyclopedia" for my future self :)</p>
